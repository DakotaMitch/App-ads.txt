The Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) developed ads.txt in 2017. Ads.txt is a framework that defines how publishers should list their authorized monetization partners. Using this file, the buy-side can identify which sellers the publisher has authorized to sell their inventory.  

The IAB released the app version for ads.txt called app-ads.txt. The specification is an extension of ads.txt.  

The simple app-ads.txt standard helps prevent the unauthorized selling of in-app inventory and app domain spoofing.
